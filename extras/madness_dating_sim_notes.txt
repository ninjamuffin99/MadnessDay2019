--
-go through the lab
-clone, fresh out of the tube
-experiment to seduce the characters
-auditor is trying to take down hank by seducing the characters
-you turn on the auditor
-special agent made to seduce, you have these ultimate powers

-cloning tubes a background, could also reuse a general lab background
-gay bar a background, maybe club advent from pn2

you are a clone, you must seduce, you pop right out of the oven and you see auditor, he will task you with seducing. if you decline he can kill you and it starts a loop with another clone. 
pick a location and the character would appear in their designated location.
chat buddy messaging works like menu and location
auditor is secret route if you play your cards right
kelzad is percentage cameo
fan stuff can be in the background
sanford and deimos drive, drive off into the sunset, go shopping at the rift
auditors computer room, what if i put my bed next to yours, haha just kidding unless
tricky in his conductor outfit, hes a dj at the dj night club, going a hot dog date with tricky
sheriff is antagonist bc he wants to seduce as well, can add a line about the sheriff/auditor rumour "some people say i look good in a cowboy hat"
jesus is a convict, you can still love him, his insecurity is he is exconvict
hank insecurity is goggles
tricky wants to make laugh
auditor is shy and socially anxious and calls people the n word because he is black, he no longer gets edgey after you love him
sanford and deimos the gay boys, gay together and try to make polyamoury work. deimos dies in this lore bc polyamoury doesnt work
e-gf, talk on chatbuddy, long distance relationship, hes shy
hank one of the dates can be revived magnify chamber, go to his house and play fortnite with the john wick skin and he goes "hes just like me", go to bakery and see giant marshmallow "lets get this bread"
hit on him with memes and it somehow works bc hes a gamer
he shows you his glasses, realistic human eyes, kiss him on the lips "i have no mouth and i must kiss"
roommate ending
go to las vegas and hank gambles, he buys you a lobster
hank does not like loud noises, he goes to the park and has autism
he takes your memes seriously like "lets get this bread" and actually goes to the bakery
marshmallow falls from the sky, be careful youll get autism
ice cream date, deimos drops his ice cream, hank knits
deimos is cute and klutzy and quirky
hank is good with his hands
what do you think a ninjamuffin would taste like
deimos' hands are on your breats
hes late for school with bread in his school
this pepper sure is green and looks at the camera
